**GeoPINONet** is a geometry-aware **Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO)** for **3D structural mechanics**.  
It predicts full-field **displacements** and **stresses** on parametric 3D geometries under two load cases:

- **Axial compression**
- **Lateral bending**

The model is trained using **ANSYS FEM supervision** together with **physics-based constraints**, including:

- Equilibrium residuals
- Constitutive consistency through Hooke's law
- Dirichlet boundary conditions
- Neumann boundary conditions

GeoPINONet is designed as a surrogate modeling framework for structural analysis across geometry families, with emphasis on **stress concentration regions**, **scaling studies**, and **geometry-aware generalization**.

## Model Overview

GeoPINONet predicts the full 3D displacement field `(UX, UY, UZ)` and the full Cauchy stress tensor `(Sxx, Syy, Szz, Sxy, Syz, Sxz)` for parametric structural geometries.

The architecture is composed of three main blocks:

### 1. PointNetEncoder

Encodes the input STL point cloud into a fixed latent representation of the geometry.

### 2. PositionalEncoder

Maps spatial coordinates into multi-scale random Fourier features, enabling the decoder to represent both smooth and high-frequency field variations.

### 3. PhysicsDecoder

Maps geometry-aware latent features and encoded coordinates into displacement and stress predictions using a thickness-aware parameterization.

Two independent branches are used, one per load case:

| Branch | Load Case         |
|--------|-------------------|
| `COMP` | Axial compression |
| `LAT`  | Lateral bending   |

---

## Training Strategy

The training loss combines supervised FEM fitting with physics-informed regularization.

### Supervised Term

- FEM displacement and stress matching from ANSYS CSV data

### Physics Terms

- **PDE equilibrium residual:** `∇·σ = 0`
- **Hooke consistency loss**
- **Dirichlet BC loss** on the fixed support surface
- **Neumann BC loss** on the load surface

### Training Schedule

A curriculum strategy is used in three stages:

1. **Data-only phase** — supervised fitting only
2. **Linear ramp** — gradual introduction of physics terms
3. **Full coupled training** — data + physics jointly

### Loss Balancing

All major loss terms are weighted automatically using learnable **homoscedastic uncertainty parameters** (`log_vars`).

### Adaptive Supervision

The `ActiveCSV` sampler refreshes the supervised subset during training and increases sampling probability near **Von Mises stress concentration regions**.

## Data Format

Each geometry case requires the following files inside the path specified in `src/config.py`:

| File                      | Description                        |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `{i}_body.stl`            | Full body mesh                     |
| `{i}_load.stl`            | Load surface mesh                  |

## Configuration

Edit `src/config.py` to define:

- Paths
- Physical constants
- Hyperparameters
- Training budget
- Device configuration

Edit `src/domain.py` to select the active subset or geometry family:

```

---

## Training

## Data Generation

The `data_generation/` folder contains scripts and CSV files used to generate the training and validation datasets for both geometry families.

### Sampling Strategy

- A **64-sample master dataset** is generated using **Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)** with centered-discrepancy optimization.
- Nested subsets of size 4, 8, 16, and 32 are extracted using **Farthest Point Sampling (FPS)**, so each smaller subset is contained in the larger ones.
- This supports reproducible scaling studies.

### Validation Split

For each geometry family, the validation set contains **16 samples**:

- 12 inside the convex hull of the training set
- 4 outside the training domain for mild extrapolation assessment

### Regeneration

```bash
cd data_generation/Plate_with_a_hole
python plate_hole_lhs_generation.py

cd ../Lug_3D
python lug_lhs_generation.py

cd ..
python scaling_study.py
```

---

## CAD Automation

The `cad_automation/` folder contains the automation workflow used to generate CAD exports for batch FEM preprocessing. It includes:

- Autodesk Inventor iLogic rules
- Macro-based export automation
- Python scripts for STL and STEP collection and renaming

This pipeline reads parametric values from CSV files, updates the CAD model, and exports:

- Body STL
- Load STL
- Fixed STL
- STEP geometry

All outputs are stored into indexed case folders for later ANSYS simulation.

---

## Notebook

The `notebooks/` folder contains the Colab-oriented training and evaluation workflow for GeoPINONet. It is intended for:

- Rapid experimentation
- Model debugging
- Visualization
- GPU-based Colab execution

> The notebook was designed for **Google Colab** and is best used with a GPU runtime.

---

## Results

The `results/` folder stores the main outputs used throughout the study:

|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `ablation study/` | Sensitivity analyses and component-wise evaluations  |
| `scaling study/`  | Performance trends across nested training subsets    |
